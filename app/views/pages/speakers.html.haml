        %h1 Jeff Casimir
        %p Jeff runs Jumpstart Lab where he teaches the best Ruby and Rails classes on Earth.  He formerly taught public middle school and high school in his hometown of Washington, DC.  Now he turns "normal people" into developers, and helps existing developers up their skills.  He has not, yet, figured out how to convert developers into normal people.

        %h1 Bryan Liles
        %p Bryan does a myriad of Ruby related tasks for his daytime job in a quaint little town near Baltimore, Maryland. No, that isn't right. Bryan Liles is Greatest Man Alive! He hacks mad ruby. He trolls twitter. He is looking for the good fight.

        %p
          He hasn't written any books, and doesn't maintain any major open source projects. Most of his time is spent helping others level up their awesomeness; trying to cause chaos with writings on his blog at
          = link_to "http://smartic.us", "http://smartic.us"
          (I know you've heard of Smarticus); or just being a great dad and husband. 

        %p Some came to lead. Some come to be lead. Bryan comes to smash the status quo.

        %h1 Jacqui Cox
        %p Jacqui is part of the Interactive News Technologies team at The New York Times. A group of  developer/journalists based in the newsroom, they work on projects that present and deliver the news in innovative and useful ways. A native of NYC, working for the paper has been one of her dreams for a long time. She's just thankful that she didn't have to start in the mail room.

        %p An active member of the Ruby community for several years, Jacqui contributes to many open source projects. She has a love of travel and adventure and might be found climbing one of the Seven Summits.

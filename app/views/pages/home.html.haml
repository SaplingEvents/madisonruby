    %h1 RailsBridge Womens Outreach Workshop
    %p The target audience is anyone who has a laptop computer and is willing to devote a Wednesday evening and full day on Thursday to learning how to develop a web application using the popular Ruby on Rails framework. Most attendees are programmers who are looking to update their skills — some are unemployed, some are hoping to leave their current jobs and others just want to keep their skills sharp and understand the latest technology.

    %p Although not exclusively for women, volunteers like Desi McAdam focus their workshops on outreach to women in order to create gender diversity in the tech community.

    %h1 Killer After-Party!
    %p When surveyed the locals had many suggestions for putting on a great event but, there was one unanimous suggestion: A Killer After-Party.  We listened. We are putting together an epic  bash to celebrate the success of our inaugural event.  The after-party will be held at the rooftop sculpture garden of the Musuem of Contemporary Art.  The soundtrack will be provided by Giles Bowkett and Rob Sanheim DJing and SXSW/Bonaroo veteran Dosh adding his unique blend of sound looped, sequenced, and blended specifically for you.

  %p In 1998, local businessman W. Jerome Frautschi made a breathtaking, multimillion dollar commitment for the development of a cultural arts district in downtown Madison. The Overture Foundation was established to solve the space needs of the city's major arts organizations, and internationally famous architect Cesar Pelli designed the project.

  %p
    Madison Ruby is taking over this venue for three days.  Using everything from breakout rooms, such as
